## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `ChartDownloadButton`: Individual chart download button
- `BulkChartDownload`: Bulk download functionality
- `chartDownload.ts`: Core download utilities

### Dependencies
- `html2canvas`: For converting charts to images
- `jsPDF`: For PDF generation
- Native browser APIs for CSV export

### Data Attributes
Charts are automatically detected using these HTML attributes:
- `data-chart-container`: Identifies chart containers
- `data-chart-title`: Provides chart titles for file naming

## Supported Pages

The download functionality is available on all major pages:
- **Global Economic Indicators**: Main dashboard with multiple economic metrics
- **Country Comparison Dashboard**: Side-by-side country comparisons
- **Inflation Page**: Detailed inflation analysis with city-specific data

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with ES6+ support
- Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions)
- Mobile browsers may have limited PDF support

## File Naming Convention

Files are automatically named using this pattern:
- Individual charts: `{chart-title}-{timestamp}.{extension}`
- Bulk downloads: `{chart-title}.{extension}`

## Performance Notes

- Image downloads are processed client-side for immediate results
- PDF generation may take a few seconds for complex charts
- Bulk downloads include delays between files to prevent browser issues
- Large charts may require more memory and processing time

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Download fails**: Check browser permissions and try refreshing the page
2. **PDF not working**: Ensure you're using a modern browser with PDF support
3. **Large file sizes**: PNG files are larger than JPG; use JPG for web sharing
4. **CSV formatting**: Open CSV files in a spreadsheet application for proper formatting

### Best Practices
- Use PNG for high-quality images and printing
- Use JPG for web sharing and smaller file sizes
- Use PDF for professional documents and presentations
- Use CSV for data analysis and further processing

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- ZIP file creation for bulk downloads
- Custom chart dimensions
